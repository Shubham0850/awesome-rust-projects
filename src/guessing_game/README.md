```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
```
- This code imports the `rand::Rng` trait and the `std::{cmp::Ordering, io}` module from the standard library. This allows us to use random number generation, comparison operations, and input/output functionalities.

```rust
fn main() {
```
- This is the entry point of the program, where the execution begins.

```rust
    let secret_number: u32 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
```
- Here, a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) is generated using the `gen_range` method from the `rand::Rng` trait. The `thread_rng()` function provides a random number generator specific to the current thread. The generated number is stored in the `secret_number` variable.

```rust
    println!("Guess the number!");
```
- This line prints the "Guess the number!" message to the console.

```rust
    loop {
```
- This starts an infinite loop. The program will continue to execute the code within this loop until a specific condition is met.

```rust
        println!("Please input your guess.");
```
- This line prompts the user to input their guess and displays the message on the console.

```rust
        let mut guess: String = String::new();
```
- Here, a new mutable string variable `guess` is created to store the user's input.

```rust
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
```
- This code reads the user's input from the console and stores it in the `guess` variable. The `stdin()` function returns a handle to the standard input, and `read_line()` reads a line of input. If an error occurs while reading the line, the `expect()` method will display the provided error message.

```rust
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };
```
- The user's input stored in the `guess` variable is trimmed to remove leading/trailing whitespace. The `parse()` method is then used to parse the input into an unsigned 32-bit integer (`u32`). The `match` expression handles the result of the parse operation. If parsing is successful (`Ok` variant), the parsed number is assigned to the `guess` variable. If an error occurs (`Err` variant), the program continues to the next iteration of the loop using the `continue` keyword.

```rust
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
```
- This line prints the user's guess to the console.

```rust
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
```
- This code compares the user's guess (`guess`) with the `secret_number` generated earlier using the `cmp()` method. It then uses a `match` expression to handle the result of the comparison. If the guess is less than the secret number, it prints "Too small!" to the console. If the guess is greater, it prints "Too big!". If the guess is equal to the secret number, it prints "You win!" and exits the loop using the `break` keyword.

```rust
    }
```
- This is the closing brace of the infinite loop. The program will continue looping until the user correctly guesses the secret number
